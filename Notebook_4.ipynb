    "\n",
    "You used correlations before to explore whether there is a positive, negative (or no!) relationship between two variables. You also assessed how strong this relationship is and whether it is statistically significant. In this case, the variables had values that ranged across a whole continuum of numbers, i.e. they were continuously distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you’ll do in this notebook is convert continuously distributed data into categories (= categorical data). Why? Because you can  group your data in a way that allows you to compare the outcome in one group to that of another group, contingent on a condition. The condition will be the potential explanation you want to explore across groups to see if it has a differential impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could create groups based on whether people died of a disease or not – and whether they lived in high-density areas or not. That gives you a 2x2 crosstab and four groups (also called a ***contingency table***). After you add the count of the number of people in each of the four crosstab cells, you are ready to make a two-way comparison: Did more people die in the high- vs low-density areas and were there more survivors in low- than high-density areas? The idea here is that you have one group that is exposed to a condition (density) more so than another group. When you run an actual experiment, the exposed group is often called an impact or treatment group while the unexposed group is the control.\n",

    "In the case of correlations, `pandas` gave you the correlation coefficient $r$ that indicated the direction and strength of the linear relation between two variables. A $p$-value indicated whether or not this relation is **statistically significant**, i.e. different from what you would get for random data patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "### A quick dive into p-values... \n",
    "\n",
    "A $p$-value measures how probable it is that what you observe differs from what you would expect, *e.g.,* compared to random chance. You want to quantify how certain you can be that your results are less probable than what could have gotten randomly. Hence, a lower $p$-value is more statistically significant than a higher one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians often select a ‘threshold’ value that indicates whether a p-value is significant-enough. While this threshold can vary across science discipline or use cases, a common threshold is 0.05. This means you expect to differ from randomness 95% of the time — and are willing to be wrong 5% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a specific example, say you run a $Chi^2$ test to determine whether people who eat more gummy bears are also more likely to die of cholera — compared to people who eat fewer gummy bears. If your threshold is 0.05 and the observed $p$-value is 0.09, then we state that the two groups are not statistically significant, because 0.09 > 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess whether the relation between an outcome and explanatory variable differs between the groups in the contingency table, we need a new statistic and significance test for categorical data. The test statistic we will use is called >> $Chi^2$ <<. While we won't go into too much detail here, those who are interested can find more information about $Chi^2$ at the end of this notebook! \n"
